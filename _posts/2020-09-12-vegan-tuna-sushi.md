  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Drain and rinse 1 can of chickpeas— add them to a food processor
    2. To the same food processor add 2 tbsp nori or dulse flakes, 1 tbsp onion powder, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp lemon juice, 2 tbsp coconut aminos (or a sweet soy sauce, can use soy sauce and maple), 1/4 cup nutritional yeast, general swirl of sriracha, 1 tsp chopped capers, 1 tsp fresh dill and 1 tbsp mustard
    3. Blend for short little bursts, you want a bit of texture, not a paste. Adjust salt if you need a little extra. Can also add vegan mayo if you’re keen but I’m keeping this whole food plant based

It's okay if the nori doesn't stick
