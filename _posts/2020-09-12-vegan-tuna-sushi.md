  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Drain and rinse 1 can of chickpeas— add them to a food processor
    2. To the same food processor add 2 tbsp nori or dulse flakes, 1 tbsp onion powder, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp lemon juice, 2 tbsp coconut aminos (or a sweet soy sauce, can use soy sauce and maple), 1/4 cup nutritional yeast, general swirl of sriracha, 1 tsp chopped capers, 1 tsp fresh dill and 1 tbsp mustard
    3. Blend for short little bursts, you want a bit of texture, not a paste. Adjust salt if you need a little extra. Can also add vegan mayo if you’re keen but I’m keeping this whole food plant based

Almost as good as the bought rolls!

It's okay if the nori doesn't stick
